# Helm Charts

## Charts

This folder contains ready-made charts for the following optional features/reference implementations

- [Knowledge Agents AAS Bridge](aas-bridge)

## Chart Linting

Chart linting is performed using [helm's CT tool](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing).

Configuration files for [CT](config/chart-testing-config.yaml) have been provided.

## Generate Chart Readme's

To generate chart README.md files from its respective values.yaml file we use the [helm-docs tool](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs):

```shell
docker run --rm --volume "$(pwd):/helm-docs" -u $(id -u) jnorwood/helm-docs:v1.10.0
```

## Confidential Settings

Some settings should better not be part of the actual deployment (like credentials to the database or the vault). Therefore, it is possible to deploy a secret with these confidential settings beforehand, and make it known to the deployment by setting the secret name in the `envSecretName` field of the respective deployments.
